      <h2>
        I am currently working as a Business Analyst at JPMorgan-Chase, and my primary role is to build reports to upper management using SAS/SQL.
      </h2><br><br>

      <h2>
        I recently build my first webpage for my daughter and immediately fell in love with HTML & CSS. I am excited to continue my self-development using websites, videos and hands on training as I have other projects in line to help family and friends build their customized webpages.
      </h2><br><br>

      <h2>
        My goal is to land a permanent role as a front-end web developer with a company that is not afraid to take a risk on someone who will be entry level... but has the passion, drive, motivation, team player attitude and analytical experience to overcome obstacles as a coder.
